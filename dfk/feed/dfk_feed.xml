      <description>Release-Day! The time has come! Here is the "Damn Fine Keyboards". What is it? A (still) small magazine for the keyboard-fun in between. Mainly you will find pictures of nice keyboards but the DFK is a base for your ideas. If you have pictures, want to write articles or building guides or produce keyboard art then contact me and let the "Damn Fine Keyboards" grow.
      Have fun with it!</description>
