<h2>how to disappear (I): antisocial networks</h2>
<time>2020-03-03</time><br><br>
That everything we do on the net is monitored, tracked and archived should be known to everyone since 06/06/2013 (link: <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Enthüllung_geheimdienstlicher_Überwachungsprojekte">Edward Snowden</a>). But what you could have been aware of even before that, or what you should always keep in mind, is that supposedly free offers on the net deal with your data. Surfing and movement profiles as well as geo-position data, purchasing behavior, contacts ... the list is long. So what happens if you've had enough of it all and want to reduce your digital footprint, as they say, to a minimum? That's what this little series is about and I want to start with social media.
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Facebook, Google, Twitter...</h3>
These social networks are, as mentioned above, at first glance free for the user. On the second, however, you pay with your data that you play to the networks - and voluntarily.
A first step to counteract surveillance is to say "goodbye" to these networks. It seems as if a life without Facebook, Google and Co. would be unimaginable and you can no longer participate in social life. This is not true! It just takes a little more work. Who wants to leave the machinery can delete his accounts with the following instructions. (Attention! Save before your data that you have stored only there!):
<br>
<br>
<span class="label">Facebook</span>.
<div id="cssyn">
&gt; Settings &gt; Your Facebook information &gt; Disable and delete <br>&gt;Delete account &gt; Next and delete account &gt; Enter Password <br>&gt; Next &gt; Delete account </div>
<br>
<br>
<span class="label">Google</span>
<div id="cssyn">
&gt; Google account &gt; Data &amp; Personalization &gt; <br>Delete service or account &gt; Delete my account.
</div>
<br>
<br>
<span class="label">Twitter</span>
<div id="cssyn">
&gt; Settings &amp; Privacy &gt; Account &gt; <br>Disable your account &gt; Disable @username &gt; Enter Password &gt; <br>Disable account</div>
<br>
<br>
<span class="label">Instagram</span>
<div id="cssyn">
https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=%2Faccounts%2Fremove%2Frequest%2Fpermanent%2F</div>
<br>
<br>
<span class="label">LinkedIn</span>
<div id="cssyn">&gt; "You" &gt; Settings and privacy &gt; Account management &gt; <br>Close your LinkedIn account &gt; Next &gt; Close account</div>
<br>
<br>
<span class="label">Xing</span>
<div id="cssyn">&gt; Help &amp; Contact &gt; The Xing Membership &gt; General<br>&gt; Cancel your free basic membership<br>&gt; Delete Xing profile &gt; Delete profile</div>
<br>
<br>
These used to be a few of the biggest of the networks.
Most of today's devices have the feature to save passwords, this is also a good place to start to see where you are logged in everywhere. You can quickly find the deletion procedures for other networks with a search query on the search engine of your least confidence.
<br>
<br>
Messenger and chat apps and programs are another story - but I will also cover.
<br>

<br>
<br>
So what is the alternative?
<br>
<br>
As a contrast to the centrality here is the decentralization. Instead of relying on networks that are hosted by only one provider (the above-mentioned), there are also networks that are organized decentrally. In most cases, it is even possible to set up its own server for the networks and that partly with very little effort.
<br>
<br>
The two largest of the decentralized networks are the following:
<br>
<br>
Diaspora (<a href="https://diasporafoundation.org">https://diasporafoundation.org)</a>
<br>
<br>
Mastodon (<a href="https://joinmastodon.org">https://joinmastodon.org</a>)
<br>
<br>
Diaspora can best be compared to Facebook and Mastodon to Twitter. With both there are the possibilities to set up your own instance, so that your data also stays with you.
<br>
<br>
A good source for alternatives to the more proprietary offers is <a href="https://prism-break.org">https://prism-break.org</a>. There you will usually find a suitable counterpart for each category.
