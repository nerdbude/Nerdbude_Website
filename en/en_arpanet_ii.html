<h2>ARPANET (II)</h2>
In <a href="https://www.nerdbude.com/en_arpanet_i.html">Part I</a> there was a rough summary of how the ARPANET (1973) was built.<br>
In order to rebuild the whole in small it needs however clearly, at least from the place, reduced hardware.<br>
The first consideration went in the direction of RaspberryPi or Raspberry Pi Zero. Disadvantage of the small single-board computers<br>
is the still high purchase price. I am aware that a single Pi is 20 - 30 euros and that<br>
is a manageable price, however, that scales up significantly with the amount it needs for the DIY ARPANET (74 pcs.)<br>
which would mean in terms of price then so about 2200 euros. Too much.<br>
<br>
Since the requirement at speed of the computers keeps within limits and the PDPs are not the most modern from today's view,<br>
standard ESP32 microcontrollers are sufficient. Price-wise seen (approx. 3, - per piece) one can minimize the costs around factor 10<br>
and has so at the end only 222, - euro less in the purse.<br>
<br>
<h3>ESP32</h3>
<img src="./images/esp32.png"><br>
<br>
The ESP32 microcontroller belongs to the 32bit microcontroller family. Depending on the version there are either one or two<br>
processors of the type Xtensa LX6 with a clock rate of 160MHz - 240MHz.<br>
The RAM of the ESP32 board has a size of 160KiB static allocated + 160KiB dynamic allocated DRAM combined with integrated ROM<br>
which also contains the bootloader. There is no internal flash memory on the ESP32.<br>
The ESP32 also has numerous interfaces such as i2c, wlan, bluetooth, ethernet, uart etc. which greatly simplifies the construction of the network.<br>
Ethernet will be interesting to establish them communication of nodes and Wifi possibly to establish the satellite connection to Hawaii.<br>
<br>
Network<br>
<br>
To really network the ARPANET, the GPIO pins of the board should be perfectly usable.<br>
The pins GPIO0 - GPIO39 can be used as input or output pins. GPIO34 - GPIO39, however, are pure input pins.<br>
The wiring is done by simply soldering the cables.<br>
<br>
<span class="label">WARNING!</span>
<div id="cssyn">
	<span class="unixshell">The hardware and pinout has not been tested yet and is pure theory here. The working pinout and cabling is recorded in the docu.</span>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Housing</h3>
The total number of computers we have in the ARPANET are 74 (!) pieces.<br>
Not everyone has the space to have 74 ESP32 lying around, so we put the whole thing in a nice case.<br>
Thanks to EBay I got a Siemens MX-2 server terminal cheap. The wonderful vintage look of the terminal fits perfectly to the project, even if the MX-2 was never really part of the ARPANET.<br>
The plan:<br>
The innards of the MX-2 will be completely removed to make room for the ESP32 and the screen will be replaced with a laptop display. A Raspberry Pi will be used as the interface.<br>
<br>
So far roughly the hardware. The exact documentation will be published when the first package makes the rounds on ARPANET.<br>
So the project continues to escalate merrily - but should be fun for a long time.<br>
<br>
In part III I will continue with the software I will use.<br>
<br>
If someone notices errors in my conception in advance - feel free to contact me. <a href="https://www.nerdbude.com/readme.html">[readme.txt]</a><br>
