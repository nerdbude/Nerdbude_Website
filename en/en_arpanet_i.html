<!-- ARTIKLE START -->
<h2>ARPANET (I)</h2>
The Internet. Infinite expanses. That was not always so.<br>
At the very beginning, the "Internet" was still manageable and you could count the computers that were involved, even if not on a<br>
Hand but in small numbers.<br>
<br>
Before you had the possibility to be cyberspacig online, to shop online, to write mails<br>
to spread his mental mischief on Facebook or in blog form ( ;) ) the Internet looked different and was called ARPANET.<br>
The ARPANET was limited at its emergence purely to the USA and was designed as a research network.<br>
Who wants to learn more about the historical development of the ARPANET the must get appropriate literature,<br>
because on the historical aspect I will deal only conditionally.<br>
Since the ARPANET was so clearly structured, a replica offers itself quasi.<br>
<br>
<h3>But why?</h3>
Mainly for the fun of learning and because I am fascinated and captivated by ARPANET for many years.<br>
Since I do not have arbitrarily much time at the disposal the project will stretch with security uach in the length.<br>
Who wants to see fast progress and the finished project within a week, I must disappoint<br>
or advise him to do it yourself ;)<br>
<br>
<h3>DESIGN OF ARPANET</h3>
But now enough of the words. May I introduce, the ARPANET (state: May 1973):<br>
<br>
<img src="https://www.nerdbude.com/images/arpanet_map.png" alt="arpanet map"><br>
<br>
... At least times roughly sketched.<br>
<br>
Now what do we see on the map?<br>
First of all, we see all the universities that were involved in the ARPANET (Harvard, UCLA, Carnegie, etc.)<br>
and which computers were used there or were connected to the ARPANET (PDP-1, PDP-11, PDP-15 etc.)<br>
<br>
<h3>Modules</h3>
The individual components/modules of the ARPANET are as follows:<br>
<br>
IMP<br>
IMPs (Interface Message Processors) are packet switching nodes and the direct predecessors of today's routers.<br>
The very first Request for Comments (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1">RFC1</a>) is about this, among other things. The IMPs are based on mini-computers of the series 16<br>
from Honeywell. The first nodes were Honeywell DDP-516, later the faster H316 were used.<br>
(Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_Message_Processor">IMP</a>)<br>
<br>
316IMP<br>
The H316 IMPs were the successors to the originally placed DDP-516 and offered special high speed serial interfaces.<br>
The H316 were among the first ever 16bit computers.<br>
(Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeywell_H316">H316</a>)<br>
<br>
TIP<br>
TIPs, or Terminal IMP written out, were the way for users of the ARPANETs to access the network directly via console.<br>
<br>
The first successful connection came between Stanford University and UCLA.<br>
One of the first commands tried was "login". However, when entering "login" the computer crashed after the second<br>
letter. The problem was fixed a few hours later, however, and login was working.<br>
<br>
So for the rough network structure it needs:<br>
15x - TIPs<br>
15x - IMPs<br>
06x - 316IMP<br>
<br>
<br>
Different mainframes were attached to the individual nodes of the universities.<br>
<br>
02x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-15">PDP15</a><br>
15x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-10">PDP10</a><br>
04x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-11">PDP11</a><br>
02x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1">PDP1</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_645">H645</a><br>
02x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_67">IBM 360/67</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_75">IBM 360/75</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_65">IBM 360/65</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_44">IBM 360/44</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/370_Model_145">IBM 370/145</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_91">IBM 360/91</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_General">NOVA</a><br>
01x - MAXC (PDP-10 Klon)<br>
01x - <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trommelspeicher">TSP</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TX-2">TX-2</a><br>
01x - MICRO 810<br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burroughs_large_systems">B6700</a><br>
01x - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1800_Data_Acquisition_and_Control_System">IBM-1800</a><br>
<br>
So our ARPANET includes a total of 36 nodes and 38 mainframes.<br>
<br>
Since 38 mainframes and 36 nodes take up a lot of space, the project will be scaled down a bit.<br>
ESP32 microcontroller boards will be used for mainframes and nodes.<br>
They are sufficient in performance, more space efficient than one (or more) PDP-11 and last but not least affordable in quantity.<br>
<br>
In Part II it continues with the hardware.<br>
