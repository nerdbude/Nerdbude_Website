<h2>FYYD</h2>
Now I move but already quite some time in the podcast universe. To be precise, since 2006 (passive) and since 2018 (active).<br>
Since the beginning of the pandemic, there is (once again) a podcast wave. Everyone starts one, all want to become famous and rich with it.<br>
Thus, of course, sprout hosters and platforms from the ground.<br>
Spotify, Deezer, etc. are of course also long with it.<br>
<br>
Now I think that podcasts should be freely accessible and basically free of charge. The possibility to support his favorite podcast, financially or however, has of course its raison d'Ãªtre. Everything can - nothing must.<br>
If one can live from supports, also beautifully. I do not want to deny anyone, because what is there better than to be able to live from what you like to do.<br>
<br>
Now, however, many platforms are closing themselves off more and more and tend to save on transparency.<br>
No Spotify subscription - no way to listen to podcasts that are only represented there.<br>
I find the statement "No Feed - No Podcast" essential important and right.<br>
Until recently, "Apple Podcasts" was also a directory that had to be served if you wanted to bring your podcast to the people.<br>
Now Apple has announced to also offer paid podcasts. It is not a "must", however, as I find a step in the wrong direction.<br>
In the course of this is also still the complete backend imploded and is now properly broken.<br>
<br>
But now enough of the Rant!<br>
It is once again time to put a wonderful project in the light.<br>
<h3>FYYD</h3>
<br>
<a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a> is a podcast directory that deserves your attention and I asked EAZY the mastermind behind <a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a> a few questions and got a hearty response.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
NB = NERDBUDE <br>
EAZY = Eazy ;)<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
NB: What means "<a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a>"?<br>
<br>
EAZY: Nothing at all, basically. I always have a few domains in stock, so that I have something on hand in case of a spontaneous attack of projectitis.<br>
<a href="https://fyyd.de">http://fyyd.de</a> was already the domain for a couple of other, of course discontinued projects before the directory.<br>
I could also do this on subdomains, but I'm a lazy person and like to have short domains.<br>
However, there aren't many four-digit domains that can cause as little trouble as possible with other companies/projects, which is why I guard them like a treasure :)<br>
<br>
<br>
NB: Since when do you host "<a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a>"?<br>
<br>
EAZY: I can't pinpoint that to the exact day, but it roughly started in the spring of 2015, with development running parallel to flattrboard.<br>
<a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a> then saw the first public light in early 2016.<br>
<br>
<br>
NB: How many podcasts and how many episodes do you have in DB?<br>
<br>
EAZY: Podcast: 37,971 and episodes: 6,310,197<br>
This is - compared to most other directories - a very low number. There are several reasons for this:<br>
<br>
1. I do NOT help myself to Apple and get info about new podcasts from there, as virtually all other directories do.<br>
With me there's only handeinetragenes. Whether that comes from users or the podcast itself, is then again no matter.<br>
<br>
2. I try to make sure that I have as far as possible no Karteileichen.<br>
I regularly fail at this, but that also contributes to it.<br>
<br>
<br>
NB: And last but not least a short overview of the used technology behind <a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a> (DB, backend, frontend).<br>
<br>
EAZY: Nice question :)<br>
In general: this is a php project. Almost everything except stories in the backend is php.<br>
Database: mysql for snappy access to simple stuff, elasticsearch for the search index.<br>
Backend: this is a vicious mix of scripts in quite different languages, some php, some bash, some tcl(!). I mostly use the language I a) want to use and b) which is the fastest for me.<br>
Frontend: The framework I use is called "fatfree framework". I love it. Naturally php, lightweight and comes with everything I need. The community is small but very fine and the developers I reach in doubt within a few minutes.<br>
CSS+Co does uikit v2 for me, although that is now outdated.<br>
I just can not get the curve to finally lift that to v3. Migration is not exactly my specialty :)<br>
<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
As you can see, <a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a> is a project that definitely deserves to be supported.<br>
A podcast directory with the right mentality.<br>
Here you can find new podcasts, create and subscribe to curated lists or check out the <a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a>iverse, but that's a whole other story.<br>
By the way, the <a href="https://www.nerdbude.com/audiocortex.html">AUDIOCORTEX</a> feed is also running at <a href="https://fyyd.de">FYYD</a> ;)<br>
<br>
Thanks of course go to <a href="https://twitter.com/eazyliving">EAZY</a> for patiently answering my questions.<br>
