<h3>Sermon Transcript</h3>
<br>
Dear congregation,<br>
Dear Believers of the Click,<br>
Worshippers of the Clack,<br>
Dear Hackers,<br>
Dear Haecksen,<br>
<br>
In this dark time I want to greet you in a wonderful materialization in the form of this Advent chronology.<br>
I am here to bring uch enlightenment in the form of RGB!<br>
<br>
Give me a warm click!!!!<br>
<br>
We have gathered here in the vastness of the Internet to celebrate the glory of keyboard machines and their mechanisms.<br>
Many of you like to spend your time in front of the modern gray boxes that connect us to the various synapses of the globe-spanning networks of the digital world.<br>
And just as many of you use input devices that deserve just as much love.<br>
<br>
These wonderful little or big keyboards that can bring us joy, can also accompany us in hard and easy times.<br>
They caress our fingers with delightful tactility, caress our ears with lush clicks or seduce us with buttery smooth linearity.<br>
The keys we want to pay tribute to here don't care who you are, where you come from, or who you love.<br>
Their love for you is unconditional and infinite.<br>
<br>
We should all take an example from these switches at this time.<br>
<br><br>
I tell you - It doesn't matter if your clicky mechanical interface is 100%, 80%, 65%, 60%, 40%, or even as small as 30% - each of these keyboards is welcome in our community and serves its purpose in our community.<br>
Surely you ask yourself "Why should I of all people still invest so much time in input devices or dulcimers in this day and age?"<br>.
I would like to give you - dear community - this answer.<br>
The answer is "Because it works and is fun"<br>.
<br>
Hardly will you come across an area in your hopefully already fulfilled life that can hold you so captive and in which you can dive so deeply.<br>
Hardly will you lose yourself more in print thicknesses, colors, shapes, layouts, microcontrollers and similar clutter than in this section of your life.<br>
<br>
Therefore, praise the diversity of your dulcimer!<br>
<br>
As the year comes to a close, let us also remember those who do not have the opportunity to use these wonderful mechanical interfaces.<br>
<br>
But we don't. Any and all of you lost souls out there have the opportunity to join ours and pay homage to the mechanical dulcimers.<br>
Come join us! We have colorful LEDs, keycaps in every color imaginable, fragrant PCBs and mate.<br>
<br>
Convert your acquaintances, nerds and nerdettes not to use the tools of the dark side.<br>
Convert your acquaintances, nerds and nerdettes to use keyboards whose functionality is in our own hands<br>.
Convert your acquaintances, nerds and nerdettes that it is more fun to hack on mechanical keyboards than on rubberdomes<br>.
Convert your acquaintances, nerds and nerdettes that they should not believe everything told in podcasts<br>.
<br>
Share your experiences, your knowledge, your enthusiasm for something so beautiful we have here.<br>
Don't exclude anyone.<br>
<br>
Anyone and everyone needs to experience how easy it is to break away from the spongy devices of mass manufacturers and push beyond the limits of what has been known before.<br>
It is easy to get the necessary parts to this happiness in the Internet networks and build your own happiness.<br>
It's easy to warm up to the subject and gain access to our circles.<br>
<br>
At this point - dear community - I would also like to mention our central organ.<br>
In the vastness of the networks you can find our audio mouthpiece at <a href="https://www.clickclackhack.de">clickclackhack.de</a> - all with "C".<br>
<br>
Give me a warm click for our audio mouthpiece:<br>
<br>
Thank you dear community.<br>
Thank you all, of course.<br>
I thank this warm, heartfelt and incredibly fluffy community full of kind individuals.<br>
I thank this community that thrives on being there for each other and also thrives on pictures of keyboards.<br>
Whether you write about your experiences with mechanical keyboards, whether you take pictures of your dulcimers - feel free to be frivolous - or whether you just talk about it.<br>
Everyone and anyone in our community is an important part.<br>
<br>
Therefore, let us pray and give thanks together to the diversity and multiplicity of our congregation.<br>
<br>
Switch ours on the board,<br>
hallowed be thy clack.<br>
Thy firmware come.<br>
Thy signals be done,<br>
<br>
As in the dulcimer so on the desk.<br>
Our daily click give us today.<br>
And forgive us our soldering faults,<br>
As we forgive our soldering errors.<br>
<br>
Lead us in temptation to build more and more keyboards,<br>
And deliver us from rubberdomes.<br>
For thine is the click and clack<br>
and the glory of mechanics.<br>
<br>
Clickedyclack!<br>
<br>
Dear community I would like to come to the end.<br>
Everybody, everybody, everybody should be aware these days if he, she, really wants to spend a lifetime typing on spongy imprecise rubberdometa keyboards or if he, she, wants to join ours and achieve the enlightenment of a mechanical keyboard.<br>
Everyone, everyone, everyone has the skills and prerequisites to become a part of ours.<br>
Question your life and of course authorities and reflect on the really important things in life - namely mechanical keyboards.<br>
Come join us and live healthier and happier lives.<br>
<br>
I dismiss you - dear community - into this wonderful day full of keyboard stuff and wish you a wonderful time with your dearest.<br>
... and, of course, with your families.<br>
<br>
Take care of each other and praise the mechanical CLICK!<br>
<br>
