<h2>The CCC turns 0x28</h2>
<time>2021-09-13</time><br><br>
an advertisement with the name "TUWAT.TXT" appeared in the TAZ.<br>
The content:<br>
<br>
<span class="label">TUWAT.TXT</span>
<div id="cssyn">
<pre>
<span class="unixshell">Daß die innere Sicherheit erst durch Komputereinsatz möglich wird,
glauben die Mächtigen heute alle.
<br>
Daß Komputer nicht streiken, setzt sich als Erkenntnis langsam auch
bei mittleren Unternehmen durch.
Daß durch Komputereinsatz das Telefon noch schöner wird, glaubt die Post heute
mit ihrem Bildschirmtextsystem in “Feldversuchen” beweisen zu müssen.
<br>
Daß der “personal computer” nun in Deutschland dem videogesättigten BMW Fahrer
angedreht werden soll, wird durch die nun einsetzenden Anzeigenkampagnen klar.
<br>
Daß sich mit Kleinkomputern trotzalledem sinnvolle Sachen machen lassen,
die keine zentralisierten Großorganisationen erfordern, glauben wir.
<br>
Damit wir als Komputerfrieks nicht länger unkoordiniert vor uns hinwuseln,
tun wir wat und treffen uns am 12.09.81 in Berlin, Wattstraße (TAZ-Hauptgebäude) ab 11:00 Uhr.
<br>
Wir reden über internationale Netzwerke – Kommunikationsrecht – Datenrecht (Wem gehören meine Daten?) –
Copyright – Informations- u. Lernsysteme – Datenbanken – Encryption – Komputerspiele – Programmiersprachen –
processcontrol – Hardware – und was auch immer.

What emerged from this ad is the Chaos Computer Club, or CCC for short, the "galactic community of living beings".<br>
Yesterday (09/12/2021), the CCC now celebrated its 40th (or just in hexadecimal: 0x28) anniversary.<br>
HAPPY BIRTDAY CCC!<br>
<br>
To this really stately anniversary of the probably largest hacker association of the universe I thought, I equal here the timeline of the club with my own and write here this small declaration of love.<br>
I am not a club member but pure sympatisant.<br>
Why? That is simple:<br>
In the city where I currently live there is no CCC or a CCC-related hackerspace.<br>
The only thing that exists here is a "Makertreff" (which is as dusty as this city) and a co-working space that is purely commercial and used for making business contacts with a "canteen" that is more like a starred restaurant.<br>
So not what I have in mind.<br>
<br>
The closest club would be the wonderful <a href="https://www.cccs.de/">CCCS (Stuttgart)</a>. However, that is 1h drive away and also not really an option.<br>
So much for now on the status quo.<br>
<br>
How did it all begin.<br>
I think my first computer (C64) I got from an uncle. However, not at the release but only in the mid-90s.<br>
This was followed by a 386 Windows 3.11 computer and the first experiences with Basic. Zack! Addicted!.<br>
<br>
It really started when the first 56k modem moved in and catapulted the new Windows 95 computer into the vastness of the Internet.<br>
Quickly it became boring just to play games and stare at BASIC. So you research Internet and also come across "other usage options" for computers.<br>
<br>
Very very quickly, the CCC then falls in front of my feet.<br>
Initially, I could (probably due to age) still not much to do with it - where are now the hacking tutorials? :D <br>
<br>
But somehow the CCC has made it into my field of vision again and again.<br>
The point at which the CCC then fully solidified in my brain was a documentation that I unfortunately never found again.<br>
I only remember Tim Pritlove talking about thinking "out of the box" (who knows which documentary that is - bring it on!)<br>
<br>
At some point, of course, people become more "adult" and when that happened to me, the CCC hacker ethics finally got the attention it deserved.<br>
Last but not least, the NERDBUDE is also based on the principles of this very hacker ethic (<a href="https://www.nerdbude.com/readme.html">PRINCIPII NERDBUDIA</a>).<br>
<br>
Now sits there the nerd and wonders how his life goes on. Hacking (in the illegal/negative sense) is not to be connected with the own values.<br>
So learn. Look at system. Understand systems. Disassemble hardware. Hardware (if possible) functionally reassemble.<br>
The old Windows box quickly gets in the way. In a time, in which there were still print media, I acquired at that time a magazine (incl. CD-ROM) with Linux (kernel ver. 2.6).<br>
So "Goodbye Windows!" and installed Linux. Three hours later I sat in front of a shell.<br>
Then nothing happened for a long time. I had no idea what that was supposed to be.<br>
Interestingly, Linux is so vernerdet that here again an intersection with the CCC arose and I got many tips and commands taught by CCC'lern.<br>
<br>
Since then, the spectrum of media, people and projects that intersect my timeline again and again and partly also linger a long time on my timeline grew and grows.<br>.
For example, the <a href="https://chaosradio.de/">CHAOSRADIO</a>, the first podcast (if that's what it was called back then) that I consciously and regularly listened to. In particular, the <a href="https://chaosradio.de/chaosradio_23">FOLGE 23</a>. To this day, my most listened to podcast episode ever.<br>
(and of course the episode is playing right now as I type this)<br>
<br>
Eventually, the other "chaos podcasts" will flush into the podcatcher: <a href="https://podcast.chaos-siegen.de/">CHAOS SIEGEN</a>, <a href="https://cre.fm/">CRE</a>, <a href="https://datenkanal.org/">DATENKANAL</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerfunk. ch/">HACKERFUNK</a>, <a href="https://www.haecksen.org/uncategorized/hckn000-das-haecksenwerk-trailer/">HAECKSENWERK</a>, <a href="https://logbuch-netzpolitik.de/">LOGBOOK:NETWORK POLITICS</a>, <a href="https://www.c3d2.de/radio.html">PENTARADIO</a> and many more...<br>
<br>
So at least the CCC has nested in my ear almost daily.<br>
The eyes are not spared either, of course, and since I won't be able to get to the famous Chaos Communication Congress anytime soon, both professionally and privately, <a href="https://media.ccc.de/">MEDIA.CCC.DE</a> provides the pictures.<br>
Also in the community of the <a href="https://www.clickclackhack.de">CLICK! CLACK! HACK!</a> podcast there are very pleasant people from the club.<br>
The last major intersection that truly changed my life was a visit around 2009 (I may be wrong) to the wonderful <a href="https://c-base.org/">C-BASE</a>.<br>
Here someone (name remains secret ;) ) suggested to me, if I have Bock on nen job in the IT, it should simply make (in addition it is to be said I neither studied computer science nor made in the context of a training).<br>
This conversation (and also the name of the member) from then, have lingered long in me and scratched every now and then. Now I sit today in an IT job, with which I do not get in the morning "the cold vomit" when I get up.<br>
Quasi my small TUWAT.<br>
<br>
Now I can say the CCC, this galactic community of living beings, influences me daily in my actions and thinking and through various people in the club environment I learn just as often.<br>
The CCC is (and I believe this can be said) the most important authority in this country when it comes to questions about digitalization, IT security and IT literacy and how to teach them.<br>
Not least because of the many volunteer projects in and around the club.<br>
Therefore, in conclusion:<br>
<br>
Dear Chaos Computer Club I wish you all, all the best for the 40th anniversary.<br>
You enrich and change my life and certainly the lives of many other people to the positive.<br>
Thanks to you, this world will be a much better place.<br>
Keep up the good work!<br>
Of course, also a big thank you to all the synapses that the Cortex CCC so far<br>
has formed and will still form and the incredible many people who make it all possible with<br>
volunteer work and expertise make it all possible!<br>
In this spirit:<br>
"Hack the Planet!"<br>
