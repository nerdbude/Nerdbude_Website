<h2>The Plague (Frankenswitch)</h2>
<time>2022-04-12</time><br><br>
<center><img src="https://www.nerdbude.com/images/frankenswitches/the_plague.png" width="500px"></center><br>
<br>
Building Frankenswitches is fun - sometimes at least.<br>
No, actually, always. In some cases, it is simply more time-consuming.<br>
Normally you can always find the Frankenswitches I build here: <a href="https://www.nerdbude.com/frankenswitches.html">[$NB] Frankenswitches</a>. On the pictures you can also see which parts were used for this. In 90% of the cases, the switches that supply the components only have to be closed and put back together with the respective parts. Sure you can still lube, film and so on, but basically the switches are built quickly.<br>
<br>
Now I recently had the idea for a, I would say, "Themed-Frankenswitch" (the idea then escalated to a whole keyboard, but more about that when it is so far). It should be good and smooth from the feeling but also fit thematically.<br>
As with most projects, the name came first - THE PLAGUE. In keeping with the plague, the switch should be rather dark and gray in terms of styling.<br>
A Box-Stem would be cool and the switch should be stiff. Now it takes a little research to find the right components (thanks to <a href="https://www.theremingoat.com/">Theremin Goat</a> and <a href="https://www.switches.mx">Switches MX</a>).<br>
<br>
After much research, the following two switches have come into focus as parts donors:<br>
<br>
<b>1. Akko Silver Switches:</b><br>
The switches have a medium gray bottom housing and a gray stem, which is even still a (pseudo) box stem of the MX compatible.<br>
Yes I am aware that they are not Box Stems in the true sense but I call them Box Stems here for simplicity.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Cherry Switches:</b><br>
Cherry switches have proven to be quite good when it comes to top housings in the past. They are produced relatively precisely and have correspondingly little wobble on the stem.<br>
For this I use the Cherry MX Silent reds I got from Farid (<a href="https://www.trommelspeicher.de">Duumvirat Podcast</a>).<br>
<br>
The Akko Silver Switches with <b>43g</b> and the Cherry MX Silent Reds with <b>45g</b> are definitely too soft. So I also have to get new springs. I took golden springs with 80g. Everyone who knows me knows that anything under 80g is too soft.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="https://www.nerdbude.com/images/frankenswitches/plague01.png" width="500px"></center><br>
<br>
So now we have everything together:<br>
- Akko Silver Stem<br>
- Cherry MX Silent Red Top-Housing<br>
- Gold Spring 80g<br>
- Akko Silver Bottom-Housing (incl. Leaf)<br>
<br>
It could be so simple - plug together - done.<br>
But not with the components. There are still a few things to do.<br>
<br>
<h3>Akko Silver Stem</h3>
The stem of the Akko switches is longer than the standard stem of the Cherry switches. Here is the comparison:<br>
<br>
<center><img src="https://www.nerdbude.com/images/frankenswitches/plague03.png" width="500px"><br>
(from left: Akko CS silver Stem | Akko CS silver Stem (shortened) | Cherry MX Silent red Stem)</center><br>
<br>
The stem is therefore shortened. It is shortened directly at the bead on the lower part of the stem.<br>
Afterwards, it is best to rework with fine sandpaper.<br>
<br>
<h3>Cherry MX Silent Red Top Housing</h3>
When first putting the switch together, there was the annoying side effect of the switch not being able to close completely.<br>
I have compared and tried many things. It was neither the stem, nor the leaf or other parts. No, it was two small bumps that are in the Cherry tops. I assume they are there so that the Cherry MX switches are inherently more stable.<br>
Well what can I say they have to go.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="https://www.nerdbude.com/images/frankenswitches/plague04.png" width="500px"><br>
(In the mark the bumps that need to go away)</center><br>
<br>
<center><img src="https://www.nerdbude.com/images/frankenswitches/plague06.png" width="500px"><br>
(here with bumps removed)</center><br>
<br>
The easiest way to remove them is with a cutter or side cutter, but care must be taken not to damage the top.<br>
Once the bumps are removed, the switch fits perfectly.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="https://www.nerdbude.com/images/frankenswitches/plague05.png" width="500px"><br>
(red = still too long | green = perfect)</center><br>
<br>
With the prototype, however, I also noticed that the sound is really terrible. If we have the switches open anyway, is gelubed what the stuff holds. The spring I have oiled with Balistol and the stem with Krytox.<br>
<br>
When everything is modified you will have beautiful Frankenswitches.<br>
As I said, I have more plans for the switches - there will be a whole "The Plague" keyboard. But more about that when the time comes.<br>
Until here - Have fun with your Frankenswitches.
