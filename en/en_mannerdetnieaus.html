<h2>Man nerdet nie aus</h2>
<time>2021-09-07</time><br><br>
Podcasts come up here again and again. Why? Because podcasts are great and a lot of fun.<br>
Thanks to the pandemic state (even if many act as if that is over - no it is not!) Podcasts sprout like mushrooms from the ground.<br>
Of course, not all that glitters is gold, but there are always gems among them.<br>
<br>
So also the "Man nerdet nie aus" podcast by Sabrina.<br>
What it's about? Nerd stuff of any kind and since I can nerd out, I asked Sabrina whether I can not nerd out with her in the podcast.<br>
In August it worked out and since yesterday evening the episode is released.<br>
It is of course about keyboards and some metatalk about the hobby.<br>
I can recommend all episodes to you. Whether the episode with me has become good you have to decide for yourself - the others I find in any case highclass.<br>
<br>
Here is the episode: <a href="https://fyyd.de/episode/7419492">Ich löt' mir meine Welt, wie sie mir gefällt</a> (Nice title :) ).<br>
Here is the Podcast: <a href="">LINK</a><bR>
<br>
So subscribe and listen!<br>
<br>
<h3>COMMENTS</h3>
[<a href="https://www.instagram.com/seven_keycaps/?hl=de">Seven_Keycaps</a>]<br>
<br>
[Seven_Keycaps]: "Tricky question, I don't know if tablets make sense in elementary school." you said on the NerdetNieAus podcast. As an elementary school teacher, I give you a "yes" back. I think for (digital) media literacy you need appropriate devices from grade 1 and tablets are the devices with the lowest barrier to entry."<br>
<br>
[Answer]: That is of course a valid point. I'm never 100% sure what I think about that point, but seven_keycaps' comment gives me very good input from a teacher's perspective. When a teacher (and I'm assuming seven_keycaps has a high level of digital literacy here :) ) says that it makes sense to introduce children to digital media at an early age, that's a point I can certainly support.<br>
(the conversation ran on Instagram and also went further. I'll leave it at the main comment, however, which hits it super)
<br>
Thanks for the input.<br>
